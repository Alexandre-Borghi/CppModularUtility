# C++ Modular Utility

## Usability status : **Don't use it**

---

This is a C++ general-purpose code base. **Use at your own risk**. (*Or really just don't use it*)

---

## Features

In development features :

 - Window abstraction
   - GLFW

 - OpenGL General abstraction


Fully supported features :

 - *Coming soon... sooner or later...*


Future potential features :

 - Window abstraction
   - SDL2

 - Good logging system

## Modularity

This code base is designed to be modular. It uses C++ namespaces to separate its modules into different parts, and is also structured into different files and folders, so that you can take parts that you want and don't have to compile the entire thing.

---

## Compiling

For the moment, this mostly works on Linux (I'm on Ubuntu 18.04) and I don't know if this compile with anything else than g++ (It probably doesn't). I plan on making it fully cross-platform.

There is a make file that uses g++ if you want to see how to compile it.

---

## Test app

The TestApp folder is just the program that I use to see if what I'm developing is working. You could use it as a starting point until I decide to make a documentation.
